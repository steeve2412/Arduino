Arduino Sensor Calibration and Timing Simulator
Project Description
This Arduino sketch simulates a sensor calibration process and provides a simple timing mechanism. It serves as a demonstration of logical and algorithmic thinking, with a focus on Arduino programming for educational assessment purposes. The sketch is designed to operate without actual hardware, using a conceptual approach to represent sensor readings and time management.

Features
Sensor Calibration Simulator: Simulates the process of calibrating a virtual sensor.
Timing Challenge: Implements a basic timer with start, stop, and reset capabilities, and the ability to adjust duration in real-time.
Setup
To get started with this project, you'll need the Arduino IDE installed on your computer.

Download the Arduino IDE from the Arduino website.
Install the IDE following the instructions for your operating system.
Usage
Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to File > Open and navigate to the location of your downloaded .ino file.
Open the Arduino.ino file.
To simulate the program's output, click on the Serial Monitor button in the upper right corner of the IDE.
The program will simulate sensor calibration and timer management in the Serial Monitor.
